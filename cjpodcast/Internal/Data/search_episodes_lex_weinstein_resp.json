He also talks about incrementality, aligning incentives, and much more.   Links: Full Links, Quotes, &amp; Notes: http://bit.ly/2soiG4r  Alex’s LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/alexweinstein/  Alex’s Twitter: twitter.com/alexweinstein  Grubhub Website: https://www.grubhub.com/   3 Key Takeaways: - Marketers need to consider incrementality, or what would have happened had they not taken a given action. - Great marketing leaders need to create a culture where failure in the pursuit of experimentation is tolerated. - For marketers to be effective, they can’t just be concerned about their own budgets. They need to be focused on ‘the bigger thing.’   --- Marketing Trends is brought to you by our friends at Salesforce Pardot, B2B marketing automation on the world’s #1 CRM.

(Weinstein has denied claims of nonconsensual sex.) And Farrow detailed a campaign of intimidation and threats that Weinstein waged against accusers.

And, as more and more women leave careers to go freelance – why are they doing it? We hear from Lucy Adams, CEO of Disruptive HR, Kirsty Holden, blogger and founder of TheMoneySavingMum.com and Anna Codrea-Rado, journalist and presenter of the podcast “is this working?” about the modern workplace. \n\nHollywood has been rocked by allegations against Harvey Weinstein. This week, he pleaded not guilty to two additional charges of predatory sexual assault and he faces a criminal trial in the New Year. He has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex.  A new documentary looks at the rise and fall of the film mogul. Jenni talks to the director of the documentary Ursula Macfarlane and to Hope D’Amore who was a victim of his alleged abuse.\n\nFedina Zhou is the President of The Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, Asia’s oldest symphony orchestra, which is celebrating its 140th year with a world tour and a first appearance at the BBC Proms.  She talks about the origins of the orchestra which was the first to introduce symphonic music to Chinese audiences and now strives to promote cultural exchanges between East and West. \n\nPresenter: Jenni Murray\nProducer: Ruth Watts",
