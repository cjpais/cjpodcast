# cjpodcast
toy podcast code for integrating into thinking flow

This will be some base level framework for me to understand how better to use CoreData in relation to podcasts, and how this will integrate into the larger context of my thinking app (cjplay). Once this is mostly stable and working to a base degree this will be merged into the cjplay repo. Or integrated using a messaging framework between the apps.
